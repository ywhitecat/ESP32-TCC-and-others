## Linux Modbus client
There is some support for a Modbus client running on Linux in the library.
I developed it for my own use and it serves my purposes, but is far from being the same quality the ESP library has.
So here more than ever the motto

**Use at your own risk!**

applies!

### Prerequisites
The files in this folder and subfolders are Linux-only. 
The `eModbus` directory contains the adapted Linux files to get the ESP library running:
- ``Client.cpp`` and ``Client.h`` are implementing the same ``Client`` class the Arduino/ESP32/ESP8266 core does provide, whereas ``IPAddress.cpp`` and ``IPAddress.h`` are supplying the class holding IP addresses the way the eModbus library likes it.
- *Note*: ``Client`` is providing a public static function ``IPAddress hostname_to_ip(const char *hostname);`` that does a DNS conversion for the hostname given. If no IP could be found, a NIL_ADDR is returned!
- *Note*: In addition to the known types, ``IPAddress`` does support initialization, assignment and comparison with a ``const char *ip``also. It is perfectly valid to conveniently write ``IPAddress i = "192.168.178.1";``.
- ``parseTarget.h`` and ``parseTarget.cpp`` are providing an ``int parseTarget(const char *source, IPAddress &IP, uint16_t &port, uint8_t &serverID)`` call to analyze and extract a Modbus server target description to a combination of IP, port and server ID. The descriptor has the form ``IP[:port[:serverID]]`` or ``hostname[:port[:serverID]]``.
- the ``Makefile`` is set up to build the `libeModbus.a` static library.

Additionally, the ``libexplain`` lib was installed to get better error descriptions. It is used in ``Client.cpp``.
If you do not want or need it, you will have to change the source there.

You will need to copy some more files from the main eModbus ``src`` folder here to complete the required sources:
- ``Logging.cpp`` and ``Logging.h``
- ``options.h``
- ``ModbusClient.cpp`` and ``ModbusClient.h``
- ``ModbusClientTCP.cpp`` and ``ModbusClientTCP.h``
- ``ModbusMessage.cpp`` and ``ModbusMessage.h``
- ``ModbusError.h``
- ``ModbusTypeDefs.h``
- ``CoilData.h`` and ``CoilData.cpp``

The main Linux directory has a `Makefile` as well to build the two examples `SyncClient.cpp` and `AsynClient.cpp`.
It makes use of the `libeModbus.a` library, so please be sure to have built that before.

### Building the example
The example was developed on **Lubuntu 20.04**, but should run on any major Linux variety.

If you have collected all the files mentioned in the `eModbus` folder, go into this folder and run ``make``.
In case all runs okay, you will have a ``libeModbus.a`` static library after ``make`` has finished.
The ``Makefile`` has some more targets:
- ``make clean`` will remove all object and reference files that may have been created during the build.
- ``make reallyclean`` will in addition remove all files copied from the main `src` folder as described above.

Now leave the `eModbus` folder again to run `make` in the folder with the examples.

### Trying the example clients
Both clients are called with 3 arguments:
```
./SyncClient <target> <addr> <words>
``` 
or 
``` 
./AsyncClient <target> <addr> <words>
```

A typical run may look like:
```
micha@LinuxBox:~/MBCLinux$ ./AsyncClient 192.168.178.77:6502:20 1 100
